\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Goals of the project}
The goal of this project is to explore, compare and extend embedded Linux build systems. \cite{web:bis-org-pl}

\chapter{Literature review}
\label{chapter:literature-review}

There are two important issues, that I faced while making literature review: firstly what kind of materials should I analyze and secondly how to extend my searches, to get a full overview of current state of knowledge on this topic.  \\

First issue was very clear in previous (20th) century - literature review was about analyzing two kind of printed materials: longer ones which were just specialist books and shorter ones which were peer reviewed articles in scientific or industry magazines.
Right now they are also available and easy accessible in electronic form and still they are most reliable sources for literature review, but not every IT engineer is using it.
Open Source Software and Open Source Hardware movement, beside creating loot of tools, also created a lot of written knowledge materials, but they are distributed in very different ways: project documentation, presentations, tutorials, source code comments, READMEs, How Tos, FAQs, wikis, finally blog and forum posts, but also in other forms.
Hopefully, because they are all available via Internet, there exist one unified way to reference them: URL (Unified Resource Locator) also known as web address or link. Because of that, this and most of other bibliographies are filled with URLs, not ISBNs. I tried to divide all of those into groups as clearly as possible.

Second thing is how to be sure that I covered everything, at least by mentioning. Search results are personalized, both by searchers behavior who is choosing keywords and also Search Engine Optimization. Nobody could tell, that this is complete, but sources are cross referenced, so after some research, the loop closed. Most important factor for choosing materials is their universality and chance that they will be not so fast outdated.

\section{elinux.org}

The Embedded Linux Developer wiki elinux.org is undeniably the most extensive source of knowledge about all aspects of Embedded Linux.
In this form it was possible to consolidate powerful community which extend its contests.
From one side it is greatly filled with a lot of technical details and still extended, but from the other the content is not always universal and some pages are not maintained.\\

The elinux.org domain was registered on 1999-11-04 \cite{web:whois-elinux} and used by a Linux specialist Tim Riker just as a placeholder \cite{web:riker} \cite{web:elinux-placeholder}.
About 2003 the Embedded Linux wiki was initiated here using MoinMoin framework \cite{web:elinux-moinmoin}.
In 2007 it was moved into Media Wiki engine, that is still in use.
On the top level, its contents are divided into two main parts: "Development Portals" about various aspects of embedded Linux and "Hardware Pages" for different development boards.
The most relevant page for this thesis is \url{http://elinux.org/Build_Systems}, but build systems are only listed there without any comparison.\\

Currently it is maintained by the Core Embedded Linux Project which belongs to Linux foundation \cite{web:linuxfoundation-celp}.
CELP is also coordinator of other important Embedded Linux activities.

\section{wikipedia.org}

Although Wikipedia allows anyone to edit articles it is the largest and most popular general reference work on the Internet.
The most important thing from my point of view, is that it redirects and groups abstract entities on the high level.
The table below summarizes pages that are most relevant for this work.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}

\end{center}






During this project, I worked on extending enumerated categories and writing first version of article \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_Linux_build_systems}.

%It's also possible to process Wikipedia contents and the DBpedia is one of the projects, that aims to transform it into source semantic knowledge.

\section{Marcin Bis publications}

In Poland, the most extensive source of written knowledge is provided by Mr Marcin Bis.
He has published two books so far: "Linux in embedded systems" (pol. "Linux w systemach embedded") in 2011 and "Linux in i.MX 6 series systems" (pol. "Linux w systemach i.MX6 series") in 2015.
The company BIS-LINUX.COM also offers various paid workshops and consultations.

\section{Conferences and workshops}

From one side there are public events, like Embedded Linux Conferences organized by CELP, from which slides and recordings are available on elinux.org:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{http://elinux.org/Category:ELC} - Embedded Linux Conference (America)
  \item \url{http://elinux.org/Category:ELCE} - Embedded Linux Conference Europe
\end{itemize}

Embedded Linux issues connected to build systems are also present on Linux Sessions \cite{web:sesja-linuksowa} coordinated by Academic IT Association from Wroclaw University of Technology. \\

From another side, private companies make mostly interactive workshops. The paid ones are organized i.e. by Marcin Bis \cite{web:bis-szkolenia}. There are also free of charge workshops i.e. ones organized by EBV in 2016, where I participated.

\section{scholar.google.com}

The phrase "embedded linux build systems" gives only 2 results  \cite{web:scholar-1}. First of them is presentation "Embedded Linux system development" by Thomas Petazzoni from year 2004. It describes only Open Embedded which is currently included as a part of Yocto Project. Second one is book "Mastering embedded Linux programming" by Chris Simmonds from year 2015. It differentiates only Buildroot and Yocto Project. \\

The phrase "embedded linux build system" gives 24 results \cite{web:scholar-2}. Most of recent works enumerates Buildroot, Yocto Project, OpenWrt without comparison between them. Materials prior to 2010 are mostly using therm "embedded linux distribution", rather than "embedded linux build system".

\section{official documentation}

The most valuable source of technical information is and always should be official documentation. URLs are situated in the bibliography and direct to the websites where more information about each project can be found.

\chapter{Development boards}
\label{chapter:development-boards}

From the beginning of embedded systems history, microprocessor development boards were just a training resource for engineers.
Usually they were designed and produced by companies that have created certain chip and costs a lot of money, that it was not affordable for hobbyists or students.
In recent years this state has been changed by a few factors:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the spread of ARM architecture micro-controllers with efficiency comparable to personal computers (1GHz),
  \item creating development boards by community as open hardware, that resulted in cost reduction,
  \item adding peripherals specific not for embedded systems but for personal computers.
\end{itemize}
This led to discovering totally new use cases for development boards which explode due to widespread success of Raspberry Pi platform. \\
I have selected some of most popular devices with ARM to compare them, but also included my personal laptop computer as a reference for x86 architecture. Because of very low popularity, I  haven't investigated other chips with SPARC or Power Architecture. \\

At minimum, each platform has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item at least one UART, for serial console
  \item at least one Ethernet port, 100 MB/s or higher
  \item at least one USB port, 2.0 or higher
  \item SD card interface
  \item low voltage (5V-24V) power supply
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem of definition}
There is much confusion in semantic layer here. Linux is just a operating system kernel, it doesn't providing any user space.
In the beginning, when it was created, there was no distributions, so if anybody want to utilize it, it had to be compiled and configured in a way later described in Linux From Scratch. After some conceptual projects, the two still most important distributions were created: Debian and Red Hat. They provides not only fully working solution, but also their own way to adding software - package management systems: deb and rpm. \\
It could be clearly said, that Linux distribution is a complete operating system, which includes certain set of software and distribution maintainers take care about preparing release version for certain hardware. Nevertheless, distributions are mostly used on personal computers, that have very standardized x86-based hardware, while embedded platforms differ very much between each other. The base idea behind distributions is that user is able to extend it and tune to own needs, while embedded systems mostly cope with non-human interfaces and need to be strongly pre-configured. \\
The lines are blurred in this area, but I will suggest using therm "embedded Linux build systems" for every set of tools, that makes it possible to create complete operating system with Linux kernel on embedded device - starting with building from source for another CPU architecture and ending with complete disk image containing bootloader, kernel and root file system. Within this umbrella therm some project identifies themselves differently as "distribution creators" or "executable documentation", but they share the same goal.

\section{Buildroot}
% https://www.slideshare.net/tpetazzoni/buildroot-building-embedded-linux-systems-made-easy-linux-conf-australia-2014

Buildroot is a simple and fast tool that enables to build a complete Linux embedded system by means of cross-compilation. During the building process a cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem, a Linux kernel and a boot loader can be generated.  Furthermore, each of these steps can be performed separately.

\section{LEDE}

OpenWrt is a Linux distribution designed for embedded devices, commonly used on home routers. It gives users a possibility to make a fully customized operating system that is not dependent on firmware supplied by vendor. However, in May 2016  a group of developers decided to fork the project and create LEDE - Linux Embedded Development Environment.

\section{Build servers}
minimal requirements vs maximum usable resources\\
1. local machine (laptop)\\
2. cloud server (payed m1.2 x large - count time on various sizes + cost + servery.pl vs Amazon AWS)\\
3. dedicated server (own... Intel Xeon)\\
4. dedicated server (payed)\\
count costs in comparison to... big mac / salary?
